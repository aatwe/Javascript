var x =5;

1) How to increment by 1
x++;

x++ => x = x + 1
x--   => x = x  - 1

2) How to increment by n
x+= n
x = x+n;

3) Preincrement vs post inncrement?
varx = 3;
 var y = x++;
//value of x is assigned to y first
//then value of x is incremented
// y = 3  x = 4

varx = 3;
var y =++x;
//value is incremented first then assigned
y = 4 x =4
