how to pass parameter to function?
Passing parameters to the function

function getMilk (bottles)


Why pass parameters to function?
So it can be used inside the block of code
Function becomes more dynamic, not just repeating some code
Can get new data and implement new data in that code
function getMilk (bottles)  {
	var cost = bottles*1.5;	//variable cost needs the bottles count	
}
